# Import Duty Calculation Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidance on calculating import duties for goods entering the customs territory.

## Basic Formula

The basic import duty is calculated as:

```
Import Duty = CIF Value × Duty Rate
```

Where:
- **CIF Value** = Cost + Insurance + Freight
- **Duty Rate** = Applicable tariff rate based on HS classification

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Determine the CIF Value

1. Obtain the commercial invoice value (FOB price)
2. Add international freight charges
3. Add insurance costs

### Step 2: Classify the Product

Use the Harmonized System (HS) to determine the correct tariff classification:

1. Identify the product type
2. Consult the tariff schedule
3. Apply the General Rules of Interpretation
4. Obtain the 8-digit HS code

### Step 3: Determine the Duty Rate

1. Verify the country of origin
2. Check for applicable trade agreements
3. Apply MFN or preferential rates as appropriate

### Step 4: Calculate Total Duties

| Duty Type | Rate | Base |
|-----------|------|------|
| Import Duty | Varies | CIF Value |
| VAT | Standard rate | CIF + Import Duty |
| Excise Tax | If applicable | CIF + Import Duty |

## Example Calculation

**Product**: Electronic Components (HS 8542.31)
**Origin**: Country X (MFN rate applies)
**CIF Value**: $10,000
**Duty Rate**: 5%

```
Import Duty = $10,000 × 5% = $500
VAT = ($10,000 + $500) × 20% = $2,100
Total = $500 + $2,100 = $2,600
```

## Special Cases

### De Minimis Threshold

Shipments below the de minimis value may be exempt from duties. The threshold varies by country.

### Temporary Imports

Goods imported temporarily for specific purposes may qualify for duty suspension under the ATA Carnet system.
